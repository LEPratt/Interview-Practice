# Interview-Practice
Just a place to store some of my interview practice and general algorithm practice.
I have decided to begin to store all of my completed practice code here on Github! 
I wish I had been doing this from the start but better late than never
Here is where I will create a library of all of the code challenges, algorithm practice and learning/practice code I create.

Most of this will not run as stand alone programs. 
I will just push the code I write to solve the problem or code that runs in the parent application.
I will try seperate each solution into a seperate project and name them appropreatly!
